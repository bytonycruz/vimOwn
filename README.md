# VimOwn Configuration

This repository contains my customized configuration for Vim, a highly configurable text editor. I use Vim as my primary editor for programming and text editing due to its efficiency and flexibility.

## Requirements

To use this configuration, you'll need to have Vim installed on your system. You can find information on how to install Vim on [its official site](https://www.vim.org/download.php).

## Directory Structure

- `autoload/`: Contains scripts that are automatically loaded when Vim starts.
- `modules/`: Directory that possibly contains additional modules for your Vim configuration.
- `.git/`: Git version control system directory. Do not modify this directory unless you know what you are doing.
- `.gitignore`: File specifying files and directories that Git should ignore.
- `plugged/`: Directory that could contain installed plugins. Do not manually modify this directory if you are using a plugin manager.
- `.vimrc`: Main configuration file for Vim. Customize it according to your preferences.
- `vimrc.sh`: This script creates a symbolic link for the .vimrc file in the home directory.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine in the ~/ directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vim-configuration.git ~/.vim

2. Run the vimrc.sh script:

    ```bash
    cd .vim
    ./vimrc.sh
